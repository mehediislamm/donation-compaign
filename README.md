-In React, the thing I like the most is setting data dynamically. For example, creating a card component where a card is dynamically generated based on data in a JSON file. I find this aspect very enjoyable.


-While working on this project, I faced a few challenges, such as storing data in local storage and retrieving data from there. Additionally, implementing a search bar caused some trouble. Even though I managed to solve the local storage issue, I couldn't figure out the search bar functionality.


-Now, let's discuss how a person can use this website. If someone visits the website and clicks on a card corresponding to their favorite product, that product will appear on a separate component on the same page. It will also display the price, and if the person clicks the donate button, the product will be added to the donation component on the website's navbar. The donation component will show the percentage of the donation in a pie chart format.
